		  <br/>
		  <p>To be able to work all together at the same time, we decided to use the following strategy.<br/>
		  Florian gave the instructions deduced by its study of the race scenarios to Sofiène who wrote all the functions dealing with the movements of the robot.
		  Thibault then added those functions to the final code, while dealing with the communication between the robot and the server.<br/>
		Because both Thibault and Sofiene had to use the robot at the same time (Sofiène to test the moving functions and Thibault to test the communication with the server), Sofiène was working and compiling directly on the robot, whereas Thibault was using cross-compilation to only send the executables to the robot.
	      Therefore, Sofiène was wirely connected to the robot, and Thibault was connected through Bluetooth.
		This allowed us to save a lot of time, especially considering the compilation (it takes a lot of time to compile on the robot, and only a few seconds to cross-compile).
