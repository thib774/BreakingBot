Custom-built for Eurecom OS Competition (rules are available <a href="http://soc.eurecom.fr/OS/projects_fall2016.html">here</a>), <strong> BreakingBot </strong> has as a brain a
LEGO® MINDSTORMS® EV3 which is connected to five elements (two motors
for the wheels, an ultrasonic sensor, a gyro sensor and a third motor
for the claw). All the elements are installed in order to have a robot
looking like a two-wheel drive car.</p>

</p>


 
<p>An <span style="font-weight: bold;">ultrasonic sensor</span> is
placed horizontally in front of the robot. It is able to provide the
distance between itself and the closest object which is in front of
him.

</p>

<p>A <span style="font-weight: bold;">gyro sensor</span>
is installed in the axis of the robot.It provides the angular position of itself - and therefore of the robot.</p>

<br>
<p>Since the robot has to grab a ball (whose diameter is around 50mm), an ingenious <span style="font-weight: bold;">claw</span> has been used. It allows both to grab the ball and to maintain it in an upper position.</p>
<p>A few months ago, BreakingBot only had a claw that could grab the
ball and keep it in front of it. But this claw either hid the
ultrasonic sensor (problematic...) or had to have the sensor on itself
(too heavy to raise). An update therefore lead to the current claw,
that is represented below:</p>
<p><center><img style="width: 480px; height: 270px;" src="images/clawside.jpg"></center><br></p>
<p>This claw is activated through the EV3 Medium Servo Motor (a). Using
several gears (b), the rotational movement is transferred forward.
Then, two symetrical combinations of two technic angular wheels (c)
which have perpendicular axes in order to change the axis of the
rotational movement. </br></p>
<p>The process that allows BreakingBot to grab a ball includes two
different sequences that are produced by a single action of the motor.</p>
<p>Firstly, when the claw is opened, the rotational movement which will
be created by the motor and converted by the gears will lead to the
shutting of the two arms of the claw. </br>
<p>Secondly, once the two arms are touching themselves (claw closed),
they provide a complete resistance which makes impossible for the
technic angular wheels and to the gears to transfer anymore energy. In
this case, the energy provided by the motorwill raise the whole claw!
</p>
<p>The process is the same but in the opposite order when the ball is dropped by the robot.</p></br>
