		<p>Let's see how our robot navigates.
		Several functions are available to make navigation possible:</p>
			<ul><li>move_sonar(distance)</li>
			<li>move_distance_forward(distance)</li> 
			<li>make_distance_backward(distance)</li> 
			<li>turn_right()</li>
			<li>turn_left()</li>
			<li>u_turn()</li> </ul>
			<p>and some others to grab the ball or drop it.
			Most of these functions do what their name implies. Here is what some of them do:</p>
<pre><code>
void <span style="color:#80BFFF">move_sonar</span>(distance){
//moves to the position where the value given by the ultrasonic sensor is <em>distance</em> +/- 5 mm
}
		
void <span style="color:#80BFFF">move_distance_forward</span>(distance){
//goes straight on for <em>distance</em> millimeters
}

void <span style="color:#80BFFF">move_distance_backward</span>(distance){
//back-pedals for <em>distance</em> millimeters
}

</pre></code>

<p>These functions are used both in the small arena and the big arena.
Let's see how they are used in the <strong>small arena</strong>. Firstly as the <strong>beginner</strong>. </p>

<pre><code>
void <span style="color:#80BFFF">beginner_going</span>(){}
	//Starting in the beginner starting area, looking at the bottom wall.
	<span style="color:#DF01A5">move_sonar(930)</span>
	//goes back until the center of rotation of the robot is at half of the height of the arena
	<span style="color:#DF01A5">turn_left()</span>
	//turns left in order to be horizontal and looking at the closest wall
	<span style="color:#DF01A5">move_sonar(436)</span>
	//going backwards until the robot is close to the ball area
	<span style="color:#DF01A5">u_turn()</span>
	//turns around itself in order to have the claw located in the middle of the ball area
	<span style="color:#DF01A5">drop_ball()</span>
	//drops the ball in the ball area
	//sends BALL message to the server
	<span style="color:#DF01A5">move_distance_backward(100)</span>
	//goes a little bit backwards
	<span style="color:#DF01A5">u_turn()</span>
	//turn around itself in order to watch the wall on the right of the arena
	<span style="color:#DF01A5">move_sonar(230)</span>
	//goes closer to the wall
	<span style="color:#DF01A5">turn_left()</span>
	//turns left in order to be in front of its destination area
	<span style="color:#DF01A5">move_sonar(230)</span>
	//goes forward until it is in the destination area
	
	//sends NEXT message to the server
	//waits for a NEXT message from the teammate 
	if <span style="color:#04B404">NEXT_message_received</span> {
		<span style="color:#DF01A5">beginner_return()</span>	
	}
}

void <span style="color:#80BFFF">beginner_return</span>{
	<span style="color:#DF01A5">move_sonar(810)</span>
	//goes backward until being a little bit higher than the ball area
	<span style="color:#DF01A5">turn_right()</span>
	//turns right in order to be horizontal and looking at the closest wall
	<span style="color:#DF01A5">move_sonar(710)</span>
	//goes backward in order to arrive on the top-left corner of the ball area
	<span style="color:#DF01A5">scan_right()</span>
	//looks at the ball on its right and grabs it
	//sends BALL message to the server 
	//goes horizontally again
	<span style="color:#DF01A5">move_sonar(230)</span>
	//moves horizontally until being closed from the right wall
	<span style="color:#DF01A5">turn_right()</span>
	//turns right in order to be watching at the beginner starting area (its direction)
	<span style="color:#DF01A5">move_sonar(230)</span>
	//goes forward until it is in the starting area
	<span style="color:#DF01A5">beginner_going()</span>
	//starts again
}
</pre></code>

<p> Here is a short representation of the trajectory of the robot as a beginner - following the code above.</p>
<p><center><img style="width: 400px; height: 400px;" src="images/GIFBeginner.gif"></center><br/>
</p>

<p>In case BreakingBot is the <strong>finisher</strong>, the pseudo-code is the one below. 
Note that "finisher_going" is like "beginner_return" but with a central symmetry. 
Likewise, "finisher_return" is like "beginner_going" with the same symmetry. :</p>
